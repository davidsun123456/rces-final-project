Question to be investigated: How's recent air quality in the United Kingdom?

Link to the dataset: [EEA Air Quality Database](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/aqereporting-8)

Three sentence to summarize my planned analysis:

To complete the investigation of the above question, I will do the following analysis:
Firstly, I will compare the concentration of different air pollutants in different years.
Secondly, I will make a map showing spatial distribution of different air pollutants based on the location of sampling sites.
Thirdly, I will analyze the historical trend of each pollutant since 2011 and see wherther the air quality got better or not.
